### Intro<A id="intro" /> [‚¨ÜÔ∏è](#agenda)

Sri Lanka (formerly known as Ceylon) is a fascinating destination for all kinds of tourists. You can try local cuisine, surfing and hiking, find the traces of old cities or enjoy rich nature with animals variety.

### Dubai<A id="dubai" /> [‚¨ÜÔ∏è](#agenda)

Our path included a plane transfer in the United Arab Emirates. Dubai is a pretty modern city in the desert with many interesting places.

It looks really rich everywhere and the metro without a driver that goes above the ground helps have a quick look at the city.

  alt="the view of Dubai"
/>

The city includes a lot of transparent tunnels with AC and escalators to live there even in summer hot. Like in movies about the future!

The giant aquarium with sharks in a shopping mall is an ordinary thing here.

  alt="a shark and a pool cleaner in the mall in Dubai"
/>

Apart from everything, the city is popular because of the biggest building in the world (829.8 m).

  alt="Burj Khalifa in Dubai - the tallest building in the world"

And the famous palm islands are also here. But I didn't have enough time to look at it not from the airplane.

  alt="Palm Islands in Dubai from the airplane"
/>

One more impressive thing there is the airport. It is soooooo colossal. It's like a city inside the city. It can take almost an hour to get from one terminal to another.

What to do there? Right, to taste the east desserts.

### Hikkaduwa<A id="hikkaduwa" /> [‚¨ÜÔ∏è](#agenda)

But finally, we are in Hikkaduwa. This is a small village by the ocean. A nice place to stay if you like big ocean waves and would like to try yourself surfing.

Hikkaduwa includes one more street not far from the ocean and small streets going deep to the island.

<CloudinaryImage
  link="v1644070601/maxhere/all-around-sri-lanka/20220115_114508.jpg"
  alt="a street view from Red Lobster Restaurant in Hikkaduwa"
/>

There are several interesting things to do in Hikkaduwa: to visit a big turtle spot and the local temple Seenigama Sri Devol Maha Devalaya.

But the main two sides of Hikkaduwas are relaxation and surfing.

#### Sunsets and the Ocean<A id="sunsets-and-the-ocean" /> [‚¨ÜÔ∏è](#agenda)

Hikkaduwa is situated on the west coast of Sri Lanka so you can meet the fabulous sunsets every evening here. It is impossible to add something to these photos. It's a view definitely worth seeing at least once.

#### Surfing<A id="surfing" /> [‚¨ÜÔ∏è](#agenda)

This is the other side of Hikkaduwa. Narigama beach has a nice spot for surfing even for beginners.

I am not a successful surfer but let me try to explain how it works. Surfing includes a lot of difficult parts:

1. Firstly, you need to get to the spot. The waves are pretty big near the bank and try to interfere with you. You go (on this step, it's better to hold the board behind you), then you swim (here, if you see the white wave it's better to leave the board and go down).

2. On the spot, you have to see the waves for yourself. Some of them are too big, and some of them are too small. The waves are grouped in sets. Probably it's one of the hardest parts - to find your wave. And it takes some time.

3. Finally, there is a wave. You have to puddle as quickly as possible to the bank on your board. Your legs are starting to go up and your head is going down. And here is a really difficult moment. You have to get up as quickly as possible. Only one jump from lying down to standing on the board. And the board is not stable at that moment it's moving! The majority of beginners get up too late.

4. And the final part of your are on the wave. You are cool and happy but you have to remember about your position. If you are too behind you will stop pretty fast and the wave will go ahead without you.

Go to step 1.

If something went out of control you feel the how powerful ocean is. Even the small wave looks like tsunami when you are inside and you are absolutely helpless.

But if everything ok it's a really nice feeling. You are high above the sea and it feels like the board has a powerful motor to drag you forward.

One more advice: don't try to stay on board as long as possible. If you are losing the speed and the wave it's better to stop to save some strength going back not from the bank

If you want to tame even a softboard (for beginners) take into account that it will take a lot of time and strength. It requires many days.

#### Sri Devol Maha Devalaya<A id="sri-devol-maha-devalaya" /> [‚¨ÜÔ∏è](#agenda)

Local religious life looks pretty various and free. Buddhism is mixed with Hinduism.

<CloudinaryImage
  link="v1644070620/maxhere/all-around-sri-lanka/20220117_140856.jpg"

### Udawalawe National Park<A id="udawalawe-national-park" /> [‚¨ÜÔ∏è](#agenda)

Udawalawe is an elephant park. It has a lot of animals and birds, awesome trees and view. But the main character here is elephant, it's not a problem to find they here.

Elephants live in a wild nature here (it's not a orphanage).

<CloudinaryImage
  link="v1644070595/maxhere/all-around-sri-lanka/20220115_064143.jpg"
  alt="a sunrise elephant in Udawalawe National Park"
/>

Sri Lankan elephant is endemic. It's not so big as African one. But believe me, it's still an elephant and it's massive.

And it's a little bit scary to be so close to them on their territory - they walk right near the jeeps with tourists. But they are peaceful.

<CloudinaryImage
  link="v1644070594/maxhere/all-around-sri-lanka/20220115_071217.jpg"
  alt="three elephants in Udawalawe National Park"
/>

At the beginning of the XIX centure, there were too many elephants that's why it was allowed to kill them.

But now nobody offends them (I hope).

### Galle<A id="galle" /> [‚¨ÜÔ∏è](#agenda)

Galle is a city not far from Hikkaduwa. It's easy to visit it by bus or by train.

<CloudinaryImage
  link="v1644070608/maxhere/all-around-sri-lanka/20220116_083442.jpg"
  alt="train ticket to Galle on the Hikkaduwa train station"
/>

The city is famous by its Fort was built in 1588 by the Portuguese.

The for is "the best example of a fortified city with a fusion of European architecture and South Asian traditions built by Europeans in South and Southeast Asia".

<CloudinaryImage

  alt="the Meeran Jumma Masjid and Lighthouse view from the Flagrock Bastion in Galle Fort"

It's impossible to imagine the feeling of middle ages portugueses who come here and see this exotic. They wasn't prepared by the internet.

But it worth to walk on the street outside the Fort too. The feeling is absolutely different from Hikkaduwa.

Unfortunately, these temples were closed. But later in Colombo we finally visited them.

### Ella<A id="ella" /> [‚¨ÜÔ∏è](#agenda)

Here we start a 4 days round trip inside the trip.

![All-around Map](all-around-map.png)

![All-around Calendar](all-around-calendar.png)

We made a list of the coolest places on the island, sorted it by how much we wanted to visit them, chose as many places as we could from the top, and created a round path from Hikkaduwa to Hikkaduwa.

We found a driver named Upul who was an amazing person to go with through most of these places for 3 days.

Ella is the first point of this trip. The way from Hikkaduwa to Ella goes up to the mountains with waterfalls and other beautiful views.

One of the main attractions in Ella is Nine Arch Bridge. We wanted to make a photo with the train on it but it was our train, we would miss it in this case :)

Here is the train but not on the Bridge, we are at the Ella train station. A lot of tourists are already waiting for it.

### Ella - Nuwara Eliya<A id="ella-nuwara-eliya" /> [‚¨ÜÔ∏è](#agenda)

Our driver went to Nuwara Eliya to meet us but we chose another transport because this train path is one of the most breathtaking in the world.

The main part is here, closer to Nuwara Eliya where the famous tea plantations start.

### Nuwara Eliya<A id="nuwara-eliya" /> [‚¨ÜÔ∏è](#agenda)

People call this city old England. This is the coldest place on the island I have visited.

#### Damro tea factory<A id="damro-tea-factory" /> [‚¨ÜÔ∏è](#agenda)

As I mentioned the city is famous because of tea plantations and tea factories. It exports tea over the world. And the women on these plantations from the ads from childhood are really here.

Damro tea factory is one of the main factories to visit. You can have a look at factory workshops and taste the tea here.

#### Pedro tea factory<A id="pedro-tea-factory" /> [‚¨ÜÔ∏è](#agenda)

Pedro tea factory is another factory to visit. It's interesting to compare everything with the first one. If you have time - why not?

Tea is sorted by its size. The smallest one is the strongest and the cheapest.

### Sri Pada (Adam's Peak)<A id="sri-pada-adam-s-peak" /> [‚¨ÜÔ∏è](#agenda)

Adam's Peak or Sri Pada is a sacred place on the island. It's not the tallest mountain but it is the most important for locals and tourists. The path to the top is not easy but every Lankan tries to do it at least once in a couple of years.

The majority of people who go up to the peak try to meet the dawn there. Some people start to climb up the mountain in the evening.

We decided to start later to avoid the people and enjoy nature. It took 2 hours for us but I think it's a good pace.

<CloudinaryImage

If the way to the top is longer travelers can buy some food or water or even stay to eat or rest on the way.

This is the destination. In Buddhist tradition is held to be the footprint of the Buddha, in Hindu tradition that of Hanuman or Shiva, and in some Islamic and Christian traditions that of Adam, or that of St. Thomas.

We hurried to reach the top as soon as possible that's why our way down took more time to enjoy the views.

### Kandy<A id="kandy" /> [‚¨ÜÔ∏è](#agenda)

We didn't plan to visit Kandy but there is no other way to our next destination. That's why we decided to make a stop to visit a famous Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic and to have lunch here. And we didn't regret it.

### Sigiriya<A id="sigiriya" /> [‚¨ÜÔ∏è](#agenda)

Probably the most bright point, visiting card of the island, our trip culmination. Sigiriya rock fortress!

The best decoration for all Indiana Jones movies! You feel like in the movie here. It's hard to believe that this is real and so old.

One more interesting place here is the place in the middle of the rock with old frescoes in a good condition. It's forbidden to make a photo there so I've made only a photo of the ladder to it. But these frescos can be found on the internet.

### Polonnaruwa<A id="polonnaruwa" /> [‚¨ÜÔ∏è](#agenda)

The next point is Polonnaruwa. This city is pretty well preserved. There is a museum with uniq exhibits.

For example, this doorstep's shape is pretty common on the island.

### Colombo<A id="colombo" /> [‚¨ÜÔ∏è](#agenda)

Time to say goodbye to our driver but our trip is not over yet. Colombo is not the capital but it's the biggest and the most modern city on the island.

<CloudinaryImage

Colombo is a city like no other but I can't explain why. It looks more like European but there a lot of not European stuff here, Like Tuc Tucs on the street.

What is especially different is Hinduism Temples.

Outside it looks like the houses from the sand on the beach but with so many details. It's hard to look away from it.

But inside it's even more effective. Everyone is busy with his god and then goes to the next one. The loud live music and the smoke are everywhere. Like a primitive ritual. European churches look much more boring inside.

Some man from the street took our hands, led us into the temple, put tilaks on our foreheads and showed us all the gods inside.

The final part of our adventure is a broken train between Colombo and Hikkaduwa. Many people lost hope and went out to take a bus. But we waited a little bit and finally got to Hikkaduwa.

### Yala National Park<A id="yala-national-park" /> [‚¨ÜÔ∏è](#agenda)

We returned to Hikkaduwa then relaxed for some time and decided to make one more one-day trip to the biggest and oldest national park on the island.

There are a lot of different animals here. Maybe, not so many particularly elephants compared to Udawalawe but it has even better views.

And the main character here is... the leopard. Every tourist wants to see it and every driver wants to show it.

The driver wanted to show us the best places, a couple of times I thought that we can roll over.

My camera didn't have zoom so you have to find the animals in some photos by yourself. But every photo has a description so it should be easier.

What about the leopard?

Drivers use radio stations all the time to track the animals. Near the end of the tour, our driver heard something from his colleagues and started to go somewhere very fast.

There was a line with cars everyone wanted to see him. We had only a minute but only the drivers saw that animal.

I started to think that there is no leopard because it was the end of the tour and it was kind of a local trick.

But we got in line one more time. The line was pretty big. But finally when we had our minute again to observe the leopard it moved. And we saw him.

It's really graceful and big. Much bigger than I thought.

### Animals<A id="animals" /> [‚¨ÜÔ∏è](#agenda)

What about the animals in general. They live peacefully everywhere on the island. It looks like a big natural park.

For example, big turtles like this one come from the ocean to Hikkaduwa beach every day. And you can even touch them.

<CloudinaryImage
  link="v1644070618/maxhere/all-around-sri-lanka/20220117_085348.jpg"
  alt="a big turtle on the beach in Hikkaduwa"

This giant monitor lizard we saw right near the Saruketha Restaurant not far from Polonnaruwa.

Like a real dragon!

  alt="Monitor lizard near the Saruketha Restaurant not far from Polonnaruwa"
/>

Elephants here are not only in orphanages or national parks. You can meet them right on the roads. And sometimes accidents happen.

/>

The first night on the island we were exhausted because the road was really long. But when we turned off the light we meet our new friends. We were afraid because we didn't know who are they. But it was just a little house geckos. They live everywhere and we even missed them in Nuwara Eliya.

<CloudinaryImage

  alt="Sri Lankan House Gecko in the Serenity Villa in Hikkaduwa"

This small animal is really loud and we couldn't find it for many days. But they live everywhere around houses.

  alt="a chipmunk on tree not far from the Serenity Villa in Hikkaduwa"

And even ants have something like a drawbridge here.

### Transport<A id="transport" /> [‚¨ÜÔ∏è](#agenda)

The main transport here is Tuc Tuc. It's not expensive but local and funny.

<CloudinaryImage
  link="v1644070616/maxhere/all-around-sri-lanka/20220116_161256.jpg"

  alt="inside Tuc Tuc on the Amarasena Mawatha street in Hikkaduwa"
/>

But the funniest transport is a bus. The bus is the king of the road here. It has the highest priority here, it is going pretty fast (sometimes on the opposite lane) and beeps all the road.

It looks smart outside.

<CloudinaryImage
  link="v1644070622/maxhere/all-around-sri-lanka/20220117_164533.jpg"
  alt="local bus in Hikkaduwa"
/>

But when you go inside it feels like you on the disco now. The music is so positive and loud, and the colorful lights on the panel around the Buddha make the atmosphere. There is also a big TV to show music videos.

<CloudinaryImage

  alt="the local bus from Galle to Hikkaduwa"

The next transport is a train here. There are different classes, this is the 3rd class carriage.

  alt="the view inside the 3rd class railway carriage in Galle"

But the view from the windows doesn't depend on the class. The ocean is amazing anywhere.

There are a lot of railways on the island. You can go throughout the west coast from Colombo to the south of the island. Or go to the mountains to see the tea plantation. It's cheap and cool way to investigate the island.

### Food<A id="food" /> [‚¨ÜÔ∏è](#agenda)

Since it's Asia rice is a very important component of the cuisine. But some local dishes are defined not by the component but by the spices used for them like curry or massala.

Meat is not popular here. Buddhists don't eat beef, and Muslims don't eat pork.

Roti is a first famous dish here.

Kottu (or Kottu Roti) is a main dish here. Basically, it's a diced roti. Sorry for the number of photos but it may vary from place to place.

Kottu Roti is a little bit similar to noodles but it's different.

Meat, fish or seafood can be devilled. It's a kind of rich hot sauce.

Omelette has it's own style here. Unfortunately some cooks try to please tourists and make it more European-like. But not all.

Hoppers are the most unique dish on the island. It has an old history. I don't know why but it took some time to find it.

<CloudinaryImage
  link="v1644070721/maxhere/all-around-sri-lanka/20220122_100607.jpg"
  alt="Hoppers somewhere in Hikkaduwa"

Usually, it's served with onion.

  alt="Hoppers with onion in Cinnamon Gate Restaurant in Hikkaduwa"

Or with Dhal Curry and Seeni Sambol.

  alt="Hoppers with Dhal Curry and Seeni Sambol in Abacate Cafe in Galle Fort"

They have an absolutely different taste. The first one is sweet and with cinnamon, and the second one is very strong, hot and spicy.

String Hoppers is a cold noodle in the shape of pancakes. We tried it in the local cafe without cutlery. The best type of cafe to visit if you want to eat real local cuisine.

Papadam is an Indian deep fried dough of black gram bean flour. Something like traditional chips.

Sometimes taking a set of the local food is a nice option. This one is with Pol Sambol and plain Roti.

You can see Dhal Curry and Green Jackfruit Curry here.

The next contains Dhal Curry, Pol Sambol, something unrecognized, Eggplant/Brinjals Pickleambol, and Papadam.

This one was the best one!

Soups are pretty ordinary here. But I don't think I've ever eaten the vegetables used to prepare it before.

Sometimes it's interesting to taste ordinary food in the places like Sri Lanka. It can be familiar and different at the same time.

Sri Lanka is a tourist developed place that's why the local cuisine is adapted. Locals made it not so spicy for tourists but not for themselves. I've read a lot about how spicy it is but in restaurants you have to ask to make it spicy. Everything is different about streetfood. It was a big mistake to buy this Vade without a bottle of water.

What's interesting about this bakery. I didn't understand how to define if the bun is spicy or sweet. It's a surprise every time.

What else is interesting, is a typical for moving bakeries music. You can wake up at 7 AM and hear this sound. It means the fresh buns are not far from you.

#### Sweets<A id="sweets" /> [‚¨ÜÔ∏è](#agenda)

There are a lot of sweets we've never tried before on the island. The easiest to find in restaurants is Watalappam.

And Sri Lanka's Kithul Palm Syrup can make it local.

I can't remember this local dessert name but it was really amazing. If you know - please contact me.

But the real desserts variety starts outside the restaurants.

I don't know the names of all of them but it definitely worth tasting all of them.

The top 1 drink here is Lassi. Its origins in India. Fruit lassi is more of a tourist option. But the one with salt is really good.

Ginger Beer is one more interesting drink to try. It's non-alcoholic but a little bit spicy.

Ordinary beer is not so interesting here. There are only two types: Lager (people calls it simply beer) and Stout. But the fact the locals prefer cricket instead of football and other sports makes it pretty unique.

Sri Lanka is a paradise-like place with magnificent nature where people and animals still live in peace. It has places for sport and for people who like history. Absolutely an all-around place.
