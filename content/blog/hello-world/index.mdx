Welcome to my finally created a personal blog! 🎉

千里之行，始於足下. This post is the first tiny step for this blog =]

Many years I wanted to start it. I was choosing the platform, the topic, the format...

#### The platform

It could be Twitter or Instagram or any other social network. But I want to feel more independent. That's why it will be my blog and I can move it anywhere at any time easily.

As for the technical side, my choice fell on Gatsby. It seems to be a solution for blogging balanced between "time-tested" and "modern enough".

And it's new to me. The best way to learn something is to try it, everybody know - practice makes better. I have experienced with React and web development but not with Gatsby and GraphQL yet. My position is Front-end Developer now, but mostly I work with JS/TS, not with UI and styles. I can't say I don't like it :), but working with UI and styles can be useful and interesting for me! And it can be my playground for kind of UI experiments.

#### The topic

I thought about separate blogs for each topic I interested in but I am not sure I have enough interesting thoughts to write about it. Let's start with the topics 🥗 "salad" blog. Because it's important to start from something. Anyway, I can split it to different blogs at any moment.

I suppose it will be mostly about **🗺️ travel, 🎲 board games, 👨‍💻 software development, 🎵 extreme music, and other stuff**. But I can't be sure at the moment :)

#### The format

Maybe I'm too old-fashioned but text blogs look better for me. And it's universal I can post photos and videos here as well.

#### Conclusion

Some people say that the modern world is the world of consuming. We look at other works much more often than create something. I work as a software engineer, so I create some stuff at work. But I want more. This blog doesn't pretend to be the most interesting blog. But I will be creating it.

Probably, it will be interesting or useful for somebody. At least for me.

I am going to try to improve my (English) writing skills here. If you are (native) English speaker it would be great if you correct me or help to make the text a bit richer.

And feel free to contact me on any question ;)
