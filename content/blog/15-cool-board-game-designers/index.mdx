Let me introduce to you 15 famous board game designers. They are like üé• movie directors - can have their own style through the works. And it's always interesting, what' new they can invent.

I can't ‚úçÔ∏è write about all the board game designers. This list is created in my humble opinion. If you know someone else who deserves to be here - write to me, and I will create **Part II** later ;)

I don't want to compare these people, that's why this list is ordered alphabetically. üòá

So, let's go to the board games üìΩÔ∏è Kubricks!<A id="list" />
