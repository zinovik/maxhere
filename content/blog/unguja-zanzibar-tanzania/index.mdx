### Intro<A id="intro" /> [⬆️](#agenda)

**Unguja** is the main 🏝️ island of the Zanzibar archipelago. **Zanzibar** archipelago is an island part of 🇹🇿 Tanzania (Zanzibar city is the only city on the Unguja island). **Tanzania** is a country in 🌍 East Africa. But people use to refer to Unguja island as Zanzibar.

During the 😷 coronavirus, many countries closed their borders or restricted their visiting, but Tanzania is open, that's why many tourists choose this country to visit.

If you want to visit Tanzania's mainland (there are some safari tours there) you should be aware of diseases like 🦟 Malaria and Yellow fever.

But for the island, 🌞 the sun is a more dangerous thing, because it's easy to completely be burnt in hours even if you are mostly in the shadow. The equator is not so far from here.

### Beaches<A id="beaches" /> [⬆️](#agenda)

Probably the main reason why the majority of tourists want to visit Unguja is 🏖️ the beaches.

I have visited only three beaches: **Kendwa** (northeast), **Nungwi** (north), and **Paje** (east).

1. **Kendwa** looks like a paradise place from the advertising, the sand there is like white snow and the water is clean and has a nice color. Probably, the best beach.

The ocean is simply perfect.

  alt="Kendwa beach"
/>

**Kendwa** is a fishing village, so you can see how the locals bring a big fish every day here.

  alt="strange shaped nets in Kendwa"
/>

2. **Nungwi** is the closest beach to **Kendwa** (you can go there by walk for 40 minutes right on the beach if the water is low). Mostly it looks the same but in the north part, it looks like **Paje**.

**Nungwi** is a fishing village too, a lot of boats here:

  alt="boats in Nungwi"

**Nungwi** situated in the north of the island, there is ⛯ a lighthouse here:

  alt="lighthouse in Nungwi"
/>

3. **Paje** is the beach in 80-90 km from the first two. I haven't seen it when water is high but when it's low it looks like 🪐 another planet. You have to walk a lot to the water if you want to swim or to kitesurf, but you can taste products of the seaweed farm during the way).

<Image
  link="v1610041302/maxhere/unguja-zanzibar-tanzania/20201227_102353.jpg"
  alt="Paje beach"
/>

It's easy to find ⭐ seastars on the beaches:

The local 🐮 cows between **Kendwa** and **Nungwi** rest in shadow while the sun is hot:

/>

Note, they have a hump like 🐪 camels. This is Africa!

### Transport<A id="transport" /> [⬆️](#agenda)

But beaches are not the only interesting thing to visit on the island. You can use local transport to go to other places. If you don't want to rent a car or motorbike you cab basically use three types of transport: 🚕 **private taxi**, 🚌 **public bus** and 💨 **dala dala**.

1. **Private taxi** is the most expensive and the most boring type of transport. It costs $20 - $50 (depends on your bargain skills) from one to another part of the island. There is usually AC there.

2. **Public bus** is absolutely ordinary transport. It costs $1 from one to another part of the island. There is usually no AC there and sometimes a lot of people.

<Image
  link="v1610041286/maxhere/unguja-zanzibar-tanzania/20201225_073851.jpg"
  alt="public bus №116"
/>

3. **Dala dala** is the local minibus share taxis. The craziest and the most fun way to explore the island. It's always overcrowded and accelerates to unsafety speeds. Every time you think it's completely full they add more people and baggage there. Some baggage is on the roof but another part is inside. Also, the roof is pretty low so you hit it with your head many times. It's really unforgettable experience.

Dala dala inside:

  alt="dala dala №116"
/>

The conductor here can hang on the back of the car only with his neck, teach Swahili people inside, invite people outside to join the trip, manage free space inside and use his cellphone at the same time! The true multitasking.

Dala dala in **Stone Town**:

  link="v1610041360/maxhere/unguja-zanzibar-tanzania/20210101_145653.jpg"
  alt="dala dala in Stone Town"
/>

There are a bus and dala dala **116** between **Stone Town** and **Nungwi**/**Kendwa** villages.

  alt="between Nungwi/Kendwa and Stone Town"
/>

Also you can use city buses in 🌁 **Zanzibar city**, it's really cheap:

<Image
  link="v1610041302/maxhere/unguja-zanzibar-tanzania/20201227_083127.jpg"

/>

I have added this photo with purpose. This conductor is a really honest man. While
others tried to cheat with 💸 the change (sometimes), he had returned everything
even the coins, while I tried to give him more money (I didn't know the price).

### Places<A id="places" /> [⬆️](#agenda)

You can visit other beaches and other interesting points on the island.

These places usually have local guides to hire. Also, if you don't want to visit it by yourself you can buy a tour. But the tours are usually a combination of the local guide, the transport (a car or a boat) and sometimes some food. Bargain skills are important to buy it at a normal price.

🏞️ **Jozani Chwaka Bay National Park** (or **Jozani Forest**) is a nice place to visit on a hot day. It is the only national park in Zanzibar. You can meet 🐒 the Zanzibar red colobus (Piliocolobus kirkii), an endemic monkey species that exists only in Zanzibar.

**Mangapwani Coral Cave** is a large natural cavern with a freshwater pool that was used as a source of 🚰 drinking water for local people and to hold the slaves before the trade. It's dark and slippery and holds many bats inside. Somewhere it's very narrow and you need climbing up in the end.

There were a lot of people who spoke different languages in the dark without the toilet and the future. The slave trade was really popular here. The Zanzibar means the land of the blacks.

It's interesting that people who accepted Islam stopped being slaves here.

--

There are many small islands over the Unguja to visit. Some of them are so small that you can visit them only if the water is low, otherwise, it will be under the water. Snorkeling is popular among these islands. But there are some bigger islands to visit.

**Kwale Island** is famous because of the Baobab Tree - the popular symbol of Africa. Usually, the way here is combined with other small islands, 🤿 snorkeling, the mangrove lagoon, and seafood dinner.

Snorkeling near the island:

Baobab (~500 years old, also, did you know the baobab fruit is edible and tasty?):

<Image

  alt="baobab"

Also, there are a lot of baobabs on **Unguja**. For example, this beautiful one grows right in **Kendwa** main street:

**Changu Island** (aka Prison Island) is the island close to **Stone Town**. You can find the old prison (that was never actually used as a prison) and 🐢 giant tortoises here. The tortoises are really impressive. They look like 🤖 massive robots, move so slowly. In 1919 the British governor of Seychelles sent a gift of four Aldabra giant tortoises to Changuu. More tortoises continue to be brought to the island from other locations for conservation. Visitors are able to observe and to feed the tortoises.

The simples way to visit Changu Island is 🛥️ the boat from the Stone Town.

### Stone Town<A id="stone-town" /> [⬆️](#agenda)

**Stone Town** is an old part of **Zanzibar city**.

**Zanzibar city** from ✈️ the plain:

  alt="Zanzibar city"

**Stone Town** is a wonderful place. It's an old town in **Zanzibar city**. **Stone town** is a mix of 4 cultures: African, Arabian, Indian, and European. The mix in all the senses - people, architecture, food, etc.

This is the arabs corner in **Stone Town**. Guess what is under lock on the wall?

This is 📺 TV :). So they drink coffee, play dominoes and watch TV in the evenings. This is a sort of party place.

The indians live here (🍂 the leaves mean they are celebrating the New Year):

This door idea is from Indian too. But in India thorns were longer and sharper and used to protect from 🐘 elephants. But there are no elephants on the island, so this is the decoration here.

But in **Zanzibar city** you can find even DDR-built apartment blocks in Michenzani:

But be careful - many buildings are in really bad condition.

For example, the House of Wonders collapsed and became the "House of Shame" at the time when I was walking close to it.

The House of Wonders (before; maybe the last photo in history before the collapse, also look like the women use their heads to carry things!):

It was the largest and tallest building of Stone Town.

It's not like the Asian cities or European cities. It has its own style and atmosphere.

Also, tourists like to visit **Old Slave Market/Anglican Cathedral** in Stone Town.

But it's not only the cathedral in **Stone Town** (despite the majority of people here are muslims). This is **St. Joseph's Cathedral**:

**Darajani Market** is a popular place to visit. It is a pity that the photos do not convey 👃 smells and the number of flies (especially the fish part).

And this is the streetfood desert - 5 000 tsh (~$1.3) somewhere in **Stone Town** (also there were some donuts here, but they were too good not to eat it before the photo):

And the fruits. The local pineapples are so sweet and juicy. It's impossible to describe how good they are.

### Bargain<A id="bargain" /> [⬆️](#agenda)

Every time you spend 💵 money you have to bargain with locals. It's really important for them. It's a kind of traditional way of modern marketing with discounts in the shop. People want not only to buy something, but they also want to feel the benefit. That's why discounts are important nowadays. But the bargain is a kind of a two-side discount. Also, it looks like two side auction with the theater elements.

To show how it's important I can provide you an example. Somebody offers something for 100 000 tsh (~$45), but he is ready to sell it for 50 000 tsh (~$22.5). If you offer to buy it for 50 000 tsh (~$22.5) in the beginning he will definitely refuse it. But if you offer to buy it for 25 000 tsh (~11.25) and then he decreases his offer price and you increase yours he will be glad to sell it for 50 000 tsh (~$22.5) in the end. So 50 000 tsh (~$22.5) is not a good price for the seller, but 50 000 tsh (~$22.5) **with a bargain** is a good price.

It's like a game when the seller not only changes the good for the money but interacts with the buyer a lot.

But it also has another side. If you can't do it well you feel cheated all the time. They start with really big prices and laugh when you offer the real ones, but then decrease theirs. And sometimes there is a situation (for example, they have not many goods) they can 🙅‍♂️ refuse any offers.

### Other<A id="other" /> [⬆️](#agenda)

It seems the overbooking is a pretty common thing here. We didn't live in a hotel that was booked, because it was busy. And we had to wait for several hours until our hotel will have been replaced with another one. It's not the best feeling where you are in another hemisphere with winter clothes (🌡️ the temperature is +30 °C here), cash in the pockets, with all the baggage but without the place to sleep. But a few days ago we realized it was not only our case here.

It so unusual to celebrate 🎉 the New Year in a country like this. First of all, the atmosphere - there is no ❄️ snow and 🎄 Christmas trees there. But the more important thing is local people don't actually celebrate it here. So, the holiday you use to consider as global and worldwide is only your holiday here (and other tourists from countries like yours). At this moment you understand how far are you from home.

I can't omit 🎲 the **board games** on the island. I saw people playing 4 games. The game looks most interesting is <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/14186/bao" target="_blank">Bao</a>. The name itself "Bao" is the Swahili word for "board" or "board game".

Also, people play <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/5072/carrom" target="_blank">Carrom</a>, <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2394/dominoes" target="_blank">dominos</a> and <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2083/checkers" target="_blank">checkers</a> here.

If you stayed not in the expensive hotel with all-inclusive you switch between two conditions all the time here:

1. Everything is so cool, I can't believe it's real.
2. Why is it happening with me, can anybody stop it?

This is the place where the 🧱 hotel wall can separate different people having dinner for $1 and $100. It's a place full of contrasts. For example, the island has problems with ⚡ electricity. It can be turned off several times per day, and nobody knows when will it work again. Sometimes it's felt like you are in a pretty wild place. I am not sure is there 🏥 a hospital at all.

But people are kind and positive and smile all the time. Even when they try to cheaе you) And this is pretty common here (🍹 the drinks become more expensive when you ask for the check because of the "party time", the private boat with bigger price can become public, and the change can be forgotten). But when you note it to them they usually fix the problem without any conflicts.

Also, it's unusual to see African people who are Muslims. I don't know why. Maybe I haven't traveled enough before or not educated enough.

Anyway, it's interesting not to bring your culture to the place you traveling to, but to dive into the local's life, to eat the local food, to go out of 🛋️ the comfort zone. Traveling is a much more interesting thing than simply resting in another country.

It's an interesting place. It's easy to find more comfort for this money in other places. But there are many things you can't find elsewhere.

And it's unbelievable that you can turn on the hot summer anytime in the year. But it has the other side. You have to return to the country without the smiles after all.

The island has hakuna matata life pace. Sometimes it looks like the majority of local people can hurry only when they drive Dala dala) The flight from the island was postponed for 1.5 hours during the giant lines.

It's so unusual to be in such a crowd in coronavirus time. But for the country where around 1.5 million people have HIV/AIDS, where the malaria and tuberculosis are some of the most popular causes of 💀 mortality... Maybe, it's not the biggest problem here.
