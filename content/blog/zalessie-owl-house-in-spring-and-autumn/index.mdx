### Intro<A id="intro" /> [⬆️](#agenda)

🌲 **Zalessie** (_za lesom_ - behind the forest) is an almost extinct village in **Bielaviežskaja pušča** in Belarus.

It's also the name of the hostel house you can stay in (<A href="https://facebook.com/zalessie" text="facebook.com/zalessie" />). Also, you can rent bicycles and kayaks here.

I have been there two times (in spring and 🍂 autumn) this year, because it's the kind of place you want to return to.

### Transport<A id="transport" /> [⬆️](#agenda)

You will not find this place on booking or airbnb. It's a kind of filter for the guests of the house.

The first time we get to this place by 🚴 bicycles (it's ~110 km from Brest).

The great thing the most part of the road is in the **Bielaviežskaja pušča**. It's a forest around and fresh air.

  alt="a track from Brest to Zalessie"
/>

It was too 🥶 cold for April and we spent the whole morning watching birds so we decided to go to the closest train station (< 40 km) to get to home.

  alt="a track from Zalessie to Arančycy"
/>

The bicycles are the best but not the only transport to get to this place.

It's possible to use a car (like we did in autumn) or a regular 🚌 bus. It's located in the forest but not far from the road.

### The owl house<A id="the-own-house" /> [⬆️](#agenda)

The owl house is a really nice place to sleep. It's located so close to the forest so you can touch it from the terrace. You can feel yourself the part of nature but still in safety.

#### Outside<A id="outside" /> [⬆️](#agenda)

Here are the main birds on the house wall: the great grey owl and long-eared owl. These birds are the symbol of the place.

  alt="the great grey owl and long-eared owl on the owl house"

The terrace can save you from ☔ rain. And the forest close to it will save you from the wind.

  alt="the owl house terrace"

A good place for 🅿️ parking.

  alt="the bicycles on the terrace of the owl house"

And for gatherings near the 🔥 fire.

  alt="a fire place in front of the owl house terrace"
/>

And for eating. The owners can 🧑‍🍳 cook lunch for you. It can be national cuisine dishes with some products from the forest.

Did you notice the owl in the previous photo? They are everywhere here!

Here is the tower for bird watching and for resting not far from the house.

  alt="a view from the forest tower to the owl house"

If you couldn't find any birds it's a peaceful place for chill and 🧘 meditation or reading anyway.

One more photo of the beautiful 🏡 house and the forest behind.

  alt="the owl house in front of the Bielaviežskaja pušča"

You can find even a kind of bird totem here!

Here is the house where the owners live. The photo before the way home.

But as I mention we returned in autumn. First time we spent a lot of time and efforts for the road and the forest tour. So we missed the fire place gatherings.

The next 4 photos is from the autumn visiting.

What a pity it's a photo, but not a video. September is a 🦌 deer mating season. At this time males scream in the forest to attract females. And it can be heard clearly in this place. It's a little bit scary in the beginning especially because there is no fence between you and the forest with the deers. But the cozy terrace illumination can calm down everyone.

And the local 🐕 dog. It came from the wild forest and the owners adopted it.

The wall on the terrace looks like a decoration, but it's natural at the same time.

#### Inside<A id="inside" /> [⬆️](#agenda)

But let's go inside the house.

  alt="inside the owl house"
/>

It so cozy because of a large number of a small details. Everything was made with love and look like it's used not for the guest but for the owners.

It's warm and alive. And I bet nobody can count the number of birds inside. It's everywhere!

You will not cold here (of course, if you go to sleep not far from the stove).

And maybe it's better to turn off this nice refrigerator to enjoy the 🔇 silence.

Something like "Even [hit] the owl on the stump, even [hit] the stump on the owl - the owl hurts anyway".

A lot of interesting 📚 books everywhere in case you didn't take yours with you.

### The forest<A id="the-forest" /> [⬆️](#agenda)

But the main attraction here is the forest. It's a natural museum. On the first trip, our host was our forest guide and showed some interesting places.

Ornithology is a hobby of our host. His profession is psychology. And this forest is a really good place for the **"puščatherapy"**.

Let's start with a 🛁 bathroom.

There are a lot of wild animals here. Here is the kitchen of some predator.

And one more. This meal was much bigger than a bird from the previous photo.

**Yuzefin** is a village not far from **Zalessie**. It's almost extinct and even deeper in the forest.

There are so many different and rare birds in these places. In the next photo, our guide is trying to attract the bird with its voice playing from the 📱 smartphone.

Nature here is not only forest, but also swamps. Cranberry grows right here.

Previously it was a great 👑 royal track in this place. You still can walk along here.

🦫 Beaver is one more local here. Some swamps were destroyed during melioration. Now there are programs to restore it. Beavers work on this problem too.

In spring forest is beautiful.

A nice view of the Dikoye (Wild) swamp - a home for so many birds.

### The birds<A id="the-birds" /> [⬆️](#agenda)

Unfortunately, I didn't have enough good 📷 camera to take photos of the birds I have seen.

But this place is perfect for birdwatching. Wild forests and swamps are the ideal places for many kinds.

Watching the birds is really calm hobby, you are 🚶 walking in the forest and can collect photos of different birds and classify it. Try yourself if you haven't tried it yet. Just start from the closest part.

If you are not in this hobby yet it's hard to notice the birds, but with a good guide, it's not a problem.

I couldn't understand the uniquity of the birds I had watched. That's why I decided to start from the birds in the 🏙️ city - the simplest ones.

Honestly, I had bought a binoculars and a bird's definer book and download the birds' application after this trip.

So, next time I will be more 💪 prepared.
