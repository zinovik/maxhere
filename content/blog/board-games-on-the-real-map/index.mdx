Many game designers were inspired by a particular real place on the 🌍 Earth: a city, a region, or a country. Sometimes it's reflected in the game's name. Sometimes you can find the uniqueness of this place in the game's mechanics.

If you like 🧳 traveling this map can be interesting for you.

You can try to guess what game is behind the marker and then click on the marker to check yourself 😉

The goal of this page is 📚 to find out more about the places that the famous games are based on. And maybe ✈️ to visit its one day.

Did I miss anything interesting? Feel free to add the comment with the game you want to see on the map!
