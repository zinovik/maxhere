Summer is a good time for a vacation. Sometimes it's not many options to go to. In summer 2021, 🇬🇪 **Georgia** was one of the not many options for me. Maybe, that's why it was a little bit underrated. But now I want to return there because there are too many interesting places to see during one ✈️ trip.

This page is bigger than it should be, but I can't remove any more photos from it. Sorry for that.

### Intro<A id="intro" /> [⬆️](#agenda)

🇬🇪 **Georgia** (locals call it Sakartvelo) is a small country between 🇷🇺 **Russia** on the north, Black sea on the west and 🇹🇷 **Turkey**, 🇦🇲 **Armenia** and 🇦🇿 **Azerbaijan** on the south and south-east.

🇬🇪 **Georgia** is really rich for the tourists: it has the 🌊 sea, ⛰️ mountains, 🍲 cuisine, and ⛪ culture. Everyone can find something interesting. Also, Georgians are 🍷 hospitable people, so feel yourself welcome guests here.

### Batumi<A id="batumi" /> [⬆️](#agenda)

**Batumi** is the second-largest city in the country. It's located on the coast of the Black Sea and offers a lot of entertainment for tourists.

The best view opens from the Sameba Church mountain. You can visit it by taxi, but it's not a big problem to go there on 🚶 foot. It's a good idea if you ate too many tasty Khachapuris.

<CloudinaryImage

  alt="the view from the Sameba Church in Batumi"
/>

But let's go closer to the city.

<CloudinaryImage

  alt="the view from the Marani hotel roof"
/>

**Batumi** streets are full of 👚 linen, coziness and relax atmosphere of the resort city.

  alt="Batumi street view"
/>

This is an old building with some pipes. Can you guess why are they needed?

<CloudinaryImage

  alt="building with pipes in Batumi"
/>

There is no central ♨️ heating in the city, that's why gas heaters are used in the apartments.

<CloudinaryImage

  alt="rain on the Beridze street in Batumi"
/>

One more ❔ question. What is the new symbol of Batumi that can be found on this building on the next photo?

<CloudinaryImage
  link="v1630161864/maxhere/gorgeous-and-tasty-sakartvelo-georgia/20210730_173559.jpg"
  alt="the building with the new symbol of Batumi"
/>

It's a 👦 boy with a flute. It can be found in different places in the city.

The streets of **Batumi** are really different. Old buildings diluted with modern and expensive-looked building. I tried to convey contrast with this video.

<CloudinaryVideo
  link="v1630161830/maxhere/gorgeous-and-tasty-sakartvelo-georgia/20210727_143913.mp4"

Old and modern **Batumi** on the same photo.

In the evening it looks especially modern because of the illumination of 🏢 buildings.

<CloudinaryImage
  link="v1630161780/maxhere/gorgeous-and-tasty-sakartvelo-georgia/20210725_221227.jpg"
  alt="modern buildings in Batumi"
/>

Many of these buildings are hotels. Probably, resort city must have a lot of 🏨 hotels. Some of them are cozy old-style like this one:

But other are more typical as from outside:

As inside:

  alt="the view from the hotel room in Batumi"
/>

Since we have a place for sleeping we can go to some ℹ️ interesting places in the city and not far from it.

If you like free walking tours you can book this one: <A href="http://batumifreetours.com" text="batumifreetours.com" />. It's a good one.

#### Alphabetic tower<A id="alphabetic-tower" /> [⬆️](#agenda)

As you can see by these photos 🔤 alphabetic tower is a good place to hide from rain)

It's a building on the sea coast dedicated to the Georgian alphabet. You can go up there to visit a restaurant or sea the amazing view of the city and the sea.

<CloudinaryImage
  link="v1630161814/maxhere/gorgeous-and-tasty-sakartvelo-georgia/20210727_154755.jpg"
  alt="the view from the Alphabetic Tower in Batumi"
/>

High buildings have tuned mass damper to reduce mechanical vibrations. Here is the one in the alphabetic tower.

  alt="a tuned mass damper on the fifth floor of the Alphabetic Tower in Batumi"
/>

The tower is 130-meter-high. The structure reminds the design of 🧬 DNA and contains 33 letters of the unique Georgian alphabet.

  alt="the view from the Alphabetic Tower bottom in Batumi"
/>

#### Ali and Nino statue<A id="ali-and-nino-statue" /> [⬆️](#agenda)

Ali and Nino is a novel about a 💕 romance between a ☪️ Muslim Azerbaijani boy and ✝️ Christian Georgian girl in Baku in the years 1918–1920.

They wanted to be together but they couldn't because of the religious differences.

<CloudinaryImage

  alt="Ali and Nino statue of love in Batumi"
/>

The statue is moving. Ali and Nino go to each other but they go through the bodies like ghosts. They can't be together 💔.

I was filming this video several minutes.

  alt="Ali and Nino statue hyperlapse video"
/>

#### Europe square<A id="europe-square" /> [⬆️](#agenda)

The square is interesting because of the Medea statue on it. If you don't know the myth you read it, it's interesting.

But in two words: Jason and the Argonauts from 🇬🇷 **Greece** were looking for Golden Fleece here. Medea lived here fell in love with Jason killed her own brother and helped Jason to find it and run away from here with him. But Jason decided to marries another woman later Medea killed her and her own children from Jason and disappeared (❤️‍🔥 burn herself).

  alt="the Medea statue on the Europe square in Batumi"
/>

#### Neptune fountain<A id="neptune-fountain" /> [⬆️](#agenda)

The fountain is located in front of the Batumi Drama Theatre. The gilded figure of the ♆ Neptune fountain expresses its power to manage water.

<CloudinaryImage

  alt="the Neptune fountain in Batumi"
/>

#### Batumi Piazza<A id="batumi-piazza" /> [⬆️](#agenda)

The **Batumi** Piazza is an 🇮🇹 Italian-style area with a mosaic of 106 m<sup>2</sup> - the largest figurative marble mosaic in Europe. The concept of the mosaic is a harmony between sea elements and a modern urban expanse.

<CloudinaryImage
  link="v1630161813/maxhere/gorgeous-and-tasty-sakartvelo-georgia/20210727_145146.jpg"
  alt="the mosaic on Batumi Piazza"
/>

#### Astronomical clock<A id="astronomical-clock" /> [⬆️](#agenda)

This clock shows not only real-time but also the position of the sun, moon, 🔭 zodiac constellation and planets, meridian, the horizon, sunrise and sunset according to sun motion, the age of the moon, and the actual motion of the moon around the earth.

<CloudinaryImage
  link="v1630161867/maxhere/gorgeous-and-tasty-sakartvelo-georgia/20210730_182217.jpg"
  alt="astronomical clock in Batumi"
/>

#### Mosque<A id="mosque" /> [⬆️](#agenda)

The 🕌 mosque is known as the "Jamia in the middle" - previously it stood in between two other mosques which have not survived.

<CloudinaryImage

There is a detail why you can understand this mosque is in 🇬🇪 **Georgia**. Can you guess?

  alt="Orta Jame mosque entrance in Batumi"
/>

The 🍇 grapevine on the doors.

#### Dancing fountains<A id="dancing-fountains" /> [⬆️](#agenda)

Dancing ⛲ fountains are a real miracle to unite people of all the cultures and ages. All the people here look happy to observe these dances.

There is a minimum of two dancing fountains in the city. The first one is more popular because it has colorful projections right on the water in the air.

<CloudinaryImage

But the second one is really good as well. A nice place to spend some time in the evening after hot daytime.

#### Sea<A id="sea" /> [⬆️](#agenda)

**Batumi** is the city on the coast of the Black Sea. For many people, it's the main attraction here.

There is a cool seaport here.

<CloudinaryImage
  link="v1630161777/maxhere/gorgeous-and-tasty-sakartvelo-georgia/20210725_185043.jpg"
  alt="seaport in Batumi"

You can observe it just walking around or from some restaurant not far from it.

<CloudinaryImage

  alt="seaport in the evening in Batumi"

It's possible to rent a boat to look at the night city from the night sea.

  alt="the Batumi view from the night boat"
/>

If there is not a best weather for a beach vacation the sea looks even better.

The city looks nice from the 🌊 sea as well.

<CloudinaryImage

  alt="the Batumi view from the boat"
/>

#### Botanical garden<A id="botanical-garden" /> [⬆️](#agenda)

The botanical garden is a famous place in **Batumi** to visit. It's not far from the city and it has an amazing collection of plants and 🌲 trees from over the world.

<CloudinaryImage
  link="v1630161792/maxhere/gorgeous-and-tasty-sakartvelo-georgia/20210726_144136.jpg"
  alt="Botanical garden in Batumi"
/>

It's really relaxing to walk here if it is especially hot.

<CloudinaryImage
  link="v1630161788/maxhere/gorgeous-and-tasty-sakartvelo-georgia/20210726_144620.jpg"

Can you read the note on the sign?

  alt="a little pond in the Botanical garden in Batumi"
/>

If not - look at the 🪞 reflection in the water.

The botanical garden is situated above the sea, so the view here is great as well.

<CloudinaryImage

  alt="the view from the Botanical garden in Batumi"
/>

There are fewer people here to rest on the ⛱️ beach.

<CloudinaryImage

  alt="the Botanical garden beach in Batumi"
/>

#### Gonio fortress<A id="gonio-fortress" /> [⬆️](#agenda)

The next stop is the Gonio fortress. It is located on the other side (south) of the city.

The 🧱 fortress is a Roman fortification. The oldest reference to the fortress is from the 1st century AD.

<CloudinaryImage
  link="v1630161829/maxhere/gorgeous-and-tasty-sakartvelo-georgia/20210728_104011.jpg"
  alt="Gonio fortress ruins in Batumi"
/>

It's hard to imagine the people were able to build working water pipes so long ago.

<CloudinaryImage
  link="v1630161829/maxhere/gorgeous-and-tasty-sakartvelo-georgia/20210728_104249.jpg"
  alt="water pipes in Gonio fortress in Batumi"
/>

Everything's so 🟩 green in 🇬🇪 **Georgia**!

<CloudinaryImage

  alt="the view from the Gonio fortress in Batumi"
/>

If you want to visit the attractions, not in the city and you don't want to rent a car you can try the <A href="https://gotrip.ge" text="gotrip.ge" /> service. It works well.

#### Mirveti waterfall<A id="mirveti-waterfall" /> [⬆️](#agenda)

Mirveti is the first waterfall on the list. The road to it goes through the boxwoods.

<CloudinaryImage
  link="v1630161789/maxhere/gorgeous-and-tasty-sakartvelo-georgia/20210726_104635.jpg"
  alt="boxwoods on the road to the Mirveti Waterfall not far from Batumi"
/>

It's not too crowded and not far from the city. Also, the Mirveti old arched bridge is pretty close to the waterfall.

<CloudinaryImage
  link="v1630161788/maxhere/gorgeous-and-tasty-sakartvelo-georgia/20210726_105124.jpg"
  alt="Mirveti Waterfall not far from Batumi"
/>

#### Makhuntseti waterfall<A id="makhuntseti-waterfall" /> [⬆️](#agenda)

Going to Mirveti and Makhuntseti you will be moving on the road near the big Chorokhi river.

<CloudinaryImage
  link="v1630161783/maxhere/gorgeous-and-tasty-sakartvelo-georgia/20210726_111325.jpg"
  alt="Chorokhi river not far from Batumi"
/>

Makhuntseti waterfall is the most crowded one. But it's really big and has a lot of tourists attractions (like rafting) and trade points here.

<CloudinaryImage
  link="v1630161784/maxhere/gorgeous-and-tasty-sakartvelo-georgia/20210726_120254.jpg"
  alt="Makhuntseti Waterfall not far from Batumi"
/>

And there is an old arched bridge here as well. It was built in the 12th century AD. Still looks pretty robust.

#### Mtirala national park<A id="mtirala-national-park" /> [⬆️](#agenda)

There is a different direction (the same as the Botanical garden) from **Batumi** but it has a nice river as well.

It's written that almost always there is a 🌧️ rain here. But I was happy to avoid it.

<CloudinaryImage
  link="v1630161820/maxhere/gorgeous-and-tasty-sakartvelo-georgia/20210729_104523.jpg"
  alt="Chakvistskali river in the Mtirala national park not far from Batumi"
/>

Mtirala has its waterfall too. But you have to walk through the 🏞️ national park to see it. Maybe that's why it looks better than the previous ones. And maybe that's why fewer people are here.

<CloudinaryImage
  link="v1630161825/maxhere/gorgeous-and-tasty-sakartvelo-georgia/20210729_114346.jpg"

  alt="waterfall slow motion in the Mtirala national park not far from Batumi"
/>

A good place to visit, walk-in, and to have a lunch after the walking.

  alt="Chakvistskali river in the Mtirala national park not far from Batumi"

### Tbilisi<A id="tbilisi" /> [⬆️](#agenda)

The next city that is definitely worth visiting is **Tbilisi**. The capital and the biggest city in the country. There is a 5.5h 🚆 train with AC from **Batumi** to Tbilisi.

<CloudinaryImage

  alt="Parliament of Georgia building in Tbilisi"

The streets of **Tbilisi** are full of Platanus trees - a good thing to hide from the burning ☀️ sun.

<CloudinaryImage

The Liberty Monument shows St. George killing the 🐉 dragon (there was a large statue of Vladimir Lenin before August 1991 in this place).

It's really nice that it's possible to save old town ruins even if there is must be a new 🛣️ road in the same place. Good job!

Pirosmani is an 🎨 artist who died in poverty, but became really famous after his death. And his paintings also became very famous and expensive.

The street cleaner is one of his paintings where he showed a man who helped him when he was without even a place to sleep.

The old town is beautiful. You can walk endlessly (if the weather is not so hot to do it).

You can use local offline 🧭 navigation to be sure you are in the right direction. It connects all the tourists place in the city. Just follow it.

Erekle II street is full of different 🍗 restaurants. Some of them are pretty expensive, but you can see the Narikala fortress from here.

It's possible to book the apartment not far from here with a cozy courtyard like this.

The courtyard is cozy but the entrance can look like a museum with old paintings inside.

Let's go through some places to visit in the city. As before I can share a service to find a guide in the city: <A href="https://tripster.ru" text="tripster.ru" />

#### Mtkvari river<A id="mtkvari-river" /> [⬆️](#agenda)

As always the city has its own river. Its name Kura (the Georgian name of Kura is Mtkvari).

<CloudinaryImage
  link="v1630161884/maxhere/gorgeous-and-tasty-sakartvelo-georgia/20210731_171252.jpg"
  alt="the view from the Bridge of Peace to the Mtkvari river in Tbilisi"

It looks not very clean in the city.

<CloudinaryImage

  alt="the view from the Nikoloz Baratashvili bridge to the Mtkvari river in Tbilisi"
/>

#### Bridge of Peace<A id="bridge-of-peace" /> [⬆️](#agenda)

The bridge was designed by an Italian architect. It had some criticism because it looks much more modern than the old town.

<CloudinaryImage
  link="v1630161884/maxhere/gorgeous-and-tasty-sakartvelo-georgia/20210731_170957.jpg"
  alt="Bridge of Peace in Tbilisi"
/>

The 🌉 bridge has many LEDs to render a message in Morse code with the periodic table of elements every hour. It means celebration of "life and peace between people".

#### Botanical garden<A id="botanical-garden" /> [⬆️](#agenda)

The botanical garden has its own waterfall inside. You can 🏊‍♂️ swim here and rest on a hot day.

#### Rezo Gabriadze marionette theater<A id="rezo-gabriadze-marionette-theater" /> [⬆️](#agenda)

This building looks really old, doesn't it?

  alt="the marionette theater building in Tbilisi"

Wrong! It was built in 1981. But it was made antique to fit the old town where it's located.

The is a smallest working clock in the city here:

#### Anchiskhati Basilica<A id="anchiskhati-basilica" /> [⬆️](#agenda)

The ⛪ church was built by the King Dachi of Iberia (circa 522-534). It's the oldest surviving church in **Tbilisi**.

#### Rike park<A id="rike-park" /> [⬆️](#agenda)

#### Leghvtakhevi canyon and waterfall<A id="leghvtakhevi-canyon-and-waterfall" /> [⬆️](#agenda)

How many cities do you know with the canyon and waterfall in the center?

<CloudinaryImage

I think **Tbilisi** is one of the very few.

  alt="Leghvtakhevi waterfall in Tbilisi"
/>

#### Mtatsminda park<A id="mtatsminda-park" /> [⬆️](#agenda)

Mtatsminda park is a nice city park on the top of the ⛰️ mountain with great views of the city.

<CloudinaryImage
  link="v1630161886/maxhere/gorgeous-and-tasty-sakartvelo-georgia/20210731_180729.jpg"
  alt="the view of Tbilisi from the Mtatsminda park"

You can get upstairs by the ordinary road or by funicular.

<CloudinaryImage

  alt="the view of Tbilisi from the Mtatsminda park"
/>

A funicular is a pretty unusual transport but the road is good for walking in any direction.

<CloudinaryImage

  alt="the view from the road from the Mtatsminda park in Tbilisi"

Also, you can visit Mtatsminda Pantheon to visit some 🪦 graves. For example, the writer Alexander Griboyedov grave is right here.

  alt="Alexander Griboyedov grave memorial in the Mtatsminda Pantheon in Tbilisi"

#### Sulphur baths<A id="sulphur-baths" /> [⬆️](#agenda)

But probably the main place in the city is sulphur 🛀 baths. That's the reason the city was founded here.

<CloudinaryImage
  link="v1630161879/maxhere/gorgeous-and-tasty-sakartvelo-georgia/20210731_163055.jpg"
  alt="the tops of the sulphur baths in Tbilisi"
/>

According to the legend, the king Vakhtang I Gorgasali (his monument is near the church above) was hunting here. He shot and killed a 🐦 pheasant and sent his falcon to find the prey. The falcon flew away and the king lost him. In search of the birds, Vakhtang Gorgasali saw that both the falcon and the pheasant got into the waters. The source turned to be hot. And amazed with this Vakhtang I decided to found here the city realizing a great advantage of that location.

<CloudinaryImage

  alt="the falcon statue in front of the sulphur baths in Tbilisi"

There are rooms for men, women, and individual rooms in the bath.

<CloudinaryImage

  alt="inside the bath building in Tbilisi"

The room contains of 2 baths: the 🥵 hot one and the 🥶 cold one.

  alt="shower in sulphur baths in Tbilisi"

The only 🪟 window is without the glass and right in the ceil.

  alt="ceil window in sulphur baths in Tbilisi"
/>

Comparing with traditional baths it's cool that it's easy to breathe here.

#### Narikala fortress<A id="narikala-fortress" /> [⬆️](#agenda)

Narikala fortress is an ancient fortress with another great view of the city. You can use a cable car or stairs to visit it.

<CloudinaryImage

The structure is known from the 4th century as a Sasanian citadel called Shuris-tsikhe (i.e., "Invidious Fort"). The Mongols renamed it the "Narin Qala" (i.e., "Little Fortress").

### Gudauri<A id="gudauri" /> [⬆️](#agenda)

The Georgian Military Road is located to the North of the capital. It looks really dangerous because of big amount of wagons on it. Other cars often overtake them.

<CloudinaryImage

#### Cable car<A id="cable-car" /> [⬆️](#agenda)

**Gudauri** is a ⛷️ ski resort. It's not so popular place in the summer. But the 🚡 cable car works here and you can enjoy the calmness and gracefulness of the mountains with fresh air.

A little more North between sheeps and cows and you are in **Stepantsminda**.

You can see a small church from **Stepantsminda**. It's a place you should 🥾 go to.

The road is not easy but it's only 430 meters up and 1.5 hours.

But the most fantastic views are on the top. Behind the **Stepantsminda** you can see massive Mount Shani (4,451 m).

  alt="the view from Gergeti Trinity Church to Stepantsminda and Mount Shani"

An atmospheric place for the religious building. But usually, churches are built in such places for 🛡️ defense.

/>

But the main thing to look at is from another side of the church - the Mount Kazbek (5,054 m).

But I was not so happy to see it without the ☁️ clouds that day.

#### Breads<A id="breads" /> [⬆️](#agenda)

Georgian like 🫓 breads very much. The main dish is Khachapuri. Almost every region has its oven type of Khachapuri.

Remember, you should eat it only with your hands!

The most famous is the Adjarian one. You can order it everywhere but the capital of this kind is **Batumi**. You can recognize it by form and an 🍳 egg with butter in the center.

<CloudinaryImage

In 2013, UNESCO added the traditional Georgian method of making wine in kvevris to its list of intangible cultural heritage.

Wine degustations are popular here. Many people create wine by themselves in a cellar.

The king of red 🍷 wines is Saperavi. It's named after the kind of grapes. But Saperavi is not only wine of this kind. Mukuzani is good as well.

The most popular white wine is Rkatsiteli. This kind of grape grew very well everywhere. But Tsinandali is also a good white one.

You prefer non-alcoholic 🥤 drinks - try local lemonade. It's pretty famous all over the world.

An interesting fact that proves one more time the uniqueness of the country: Georgians count not by 10, but by 20: not twenty, thirty, forty, but something like twenty, twenty and ten, two-twenty...

It's impossible to put all impressions on one page. I have no more space for amazing toasts by <A href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=YgAQu8O7gFg" text="Vaja Davitadze" />, for stories about two crazy 🏎️ drivers in Georgia and one in my country on the way home, and much more...

It was really nice trip, but I haven't been to **Svaneti** yet. Hope to return there one day.
