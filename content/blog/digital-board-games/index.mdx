Are you in üò∑ quarantine, but still want to play?
Or someone you want to play with is far from you?
Or you want to train your skills with ü§ñ bots, to try a cool new strategy?

Maybe you don't have enough üí∏ money to buy a new game?
Or you can't buy it because it was run out? It often happens to me.
Maybe, you can buy it, but you want to try something before buying it?

Or maybe you want to take your favorite game with you on the ‚úàÔ∏è trip?
Or to have the possibility to play something when you almost don't have ‚åõ time or waiting in the queue?

If you answer Yes to any question or you simply want to try something üÜï new - this page may be useful for you ;)

This is the page where I've tried to create a table with all the places where you can play popular board games online or with your üì± device. Why have I created it? Because most of the lists are not useful or/and outdated.

And if you don't have anybody to play with, check these Discord servers: <a href="https://discord.gg/U3UDQtu" target="_blank">boardgames (discord.gg/U3UDQtu)</a> and <a href="https://discord.gg/meavpsC" target="_blank">Tabletopia (discord.gg/meavpsC)</a>.

Also, I worked on my own game server. It was not a business project - I tried to learn new technologies this way.
Maybe one day I will write an article about it, but now you can check it here: <a href="https://z-games.netlify.app" target="_blank">z-games.netlify.app</a>.

I have 4 games there:
- <Game gameName="No Thanks!" />
- <Game gameName="Perudo" />
- <Game gameName="Lost Cities" />
- <Game gameName="6 nimmt!" />

And if you want to play <Game gameName="Decrypto" />, I have a Telegram bot for you here: <a href="https://t.me/decryptoboardgamebot" target="_blank">t.me/decryptoboardgamebot</a>.
